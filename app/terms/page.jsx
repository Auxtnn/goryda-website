            registered to operate as a passenger transportation vehicle in the
            territory; (b) owned or leased by you, or otherwise in your lawful

            condition; (e) free from the smell of smoke or strong fragrances. As
            a drive, you will not smoke or vape inside your vehicle while
            discharging transportation services. As a driver, you will not
            engage in reckless behaviour while driving, or drive unsafely, or
            permit an unauthorized third party to accompany you in the vehicle,
            or use dangerous substance while discharging transportation services
            for prearranged ride or logged on to any GORYDA digital network. You
            understand that GORYDA will maintains a “zero tolerance’’ controlled
            dangerous substance and alcohol policy and further agree that you
            shall not take any action that harms or threatens to harm the safety
            of the GORYDA community or third party. As a driver, you will only
            discharge transportation services using the vehicle that has been
            reported to, and approved by GORYDA and for which supporting
            documentation has been provided to GORYDA and drivers are not to
            transport more passengers than can securely be seated in such
            vehicle. Also you will not attempt to defraud GORYDA or riders on
            the GORYDA App in provision of transportation services. If GORYDA
            suspect that you have engaged in fraudulent activity, GORYDA may
            withhold transport fees accrue to the driver by weekend without 5%
            interest, whilst prosecute him/her. Drivers may refuse to make
            accommodation in the vehicle for animals it reasonably believe will
            be harmful. As a driver, if you understand that the vehicle with
            which you render transportation services has a lien against it, or
            you are not the owner of the vehicle, you must notify GORYDA the
            owner or lienholder of your intent to render transportation services
            with the vehicle prior to discharge of transportation services. All
            communication regarding this Terms will be conducted through GORYDA
            App. As a driver, you will not coerce passengers or their caregivers
            to make changes to accommodate your needs for being a driver. You
            will not have additional non-approved passengers in the vehicle
            while conducting a GORYDA trip. Be informed that you shall not
            discharge transportation services for purpose of child trafficking.
            Also you are required to notify GORYDA immediately of any changes in
            your address, vehicle, criminal or driving record. Drivers are
            required to report any conflict that may exist with the number of

            driving capacities.
